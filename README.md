# MobileVRCamera Data protection

MobileVRCamera is developed by Felix and Christian

MobileVRCamera accesses and records camera sensor and microphone data, which is used for the purpose of taking photos, to fulfil its purpose as a camera. Microphone permission had to be asked to use the camera features we need.

MobileVRCamera requires permission (at least for Android 9 and earlier) to "access photos, media and files on your devices" (storage permission), as this permission is required for Android to save resultant files such as photos and videos to your device.

Bluetooth permissions are used to allow the stereo image caputure feature to discover and connect to Bluetooth devices; the Bluetooth remote control feature also requires location permission (on Android 11 or earlier) or Nearby Devices permission (on Android 12 or later).

Resultant data such as photos or videos can be shared with other apps if you use the share option in MobileVRCamera, or when MobileVRCamera is called by another app on your device, or when you use the Storage Access Framework option to save to another app or service.

Data handling procedures, data retention and deletion policies: MobileVRCamera a does not transmit personal or sensitive information to us.

Since MobileVRCamera also uses operating system APIs, you should review relevant privacy policies such as for your device, manufacturer, operating system and/or Google accounts. For example:
